            <p>
                Get to know a little about me. I was born and raised here in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte.
                Studied primary at Punta Elementary School. My likes are watching anime, playing games,
                and sometimes I love to draw, I choose IT, because it was suggestion by my parents and during
                that time, I am still undecided what course to take and what career path to walk on. Therefore,
                I followed their suggestion.

            <p>
                I spent my time more on playing games, hanging out with my friends and going to other places
                we planned on. Highschool was also the best years that I experienced. A lot of fun memories
                were created, new friends, new environment. Everything was different.

                    When it comes to Filipino cuisine, one of the first dishes that comes to mind is the iconic adobo. 
                    Characterized by its delicious salty-sour taste and fragrance from the laurel leaves, 
                    it's definitely one of the best dishes to represent our local food. Because of its popularity, 
                    it has spawned various adobong baboy recipes and adobong manok recipes all around the country, 
                    each having its own unique twist.
